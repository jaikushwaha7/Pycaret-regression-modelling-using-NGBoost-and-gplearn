It begins by building a population of naive random formulas to represent a relationship between known independent variables and their dependent variable targets to predict new data. Each successive generation of programs is then evolved from the one that came before it by selecting the fittest individuals from the population to undergo genetic operations.\n",

    "### 👉 Writing Custom Class\n",
    "The above two examples gplearn and ngboost are custom models for pycaret as they are not available in the default library but you can use them just like you can use any other out-of-the-box models. However, there may be a use-case that involves writing your own algorithm (i.e. maths behind the algorithm), in which case you can inherit the base class from sklearn and write your own maths.\n",
    "Let’s create a naive estimator which learns the mean value of target variable during fit stage and predicts the same mean value for all new data points, irrespective of X input (probably not useful in real life, but just to make demonstrate the functionality)."
